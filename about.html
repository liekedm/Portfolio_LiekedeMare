            <h1> About </h1>
                <p> I am Lieke de Mare, a third year Industrial design student at the Technical University of Eindhoven. Outside my study I am active at the scouting, other hobbies include photography and tinkering.</p>
                <h2>Vision as designer</h2>
                    <p> I’m drawn to healthcare for not only the reason of helping the people most in need but also because I’m interested in the medical field. Everyone is different and has different needs. There are many disabilities which can result in problems you wouldn’t expect, for example how physical disabilities can limit everyday tasks. Design can help is by adapting everyday products to people with special needs, to make sure they are able to live as independently as possible.
                    <p> The medical worlds is evolving and there are more and more ways to help people improve their living quality, but sometimes it seems to me that the medical world only sees the broken bodies that need to be fixed but not the human inside the bodies. This results in great working therapies and procedures but which are not always perceived well by patients. In my opinion industrial design can be the bridge between the medical world and the patients. For example when looking at rehabilitation programs. Doctors provide exercises to patients, to improve after a medical procedure or physical problem, but for patients it might be hard to do these exercises correctly independently or to find the motivation. Products can be designed to provide motivation, make rehabilitation more fun or provide tools to make the exercises easier to perform at home.
                    <p> To make a design suited for the users it is important to get to know the user group, what do they miss in what is currently provided and what are there needs. A theory that I find very important is the self-determination theory, this theory goes further that the physical needs and looks into the psychological needs. Three basic needs are: competence, autonomy and relatedness. These are important factors to deal with within a design. It shows how important it is to give autonomy to the user. This suits well for my goals in the health sector, involve patients in their own healthcare.
                </br> <h2>Identity as designer</h2>
                    <p> I’m a very goal focused designer. In the case of my main interested healthcare it doesn’t seem possible to be completely user focused while there are many other standpoints, like the medical side and the other stakeholders like healthcare professionals. Although I want to be user focused and truly design for the user I understand that a product needs to be liable. </p>
                    <p> Goal focused also means that I have a core purpose of the design, other aspects are designed to support this core purpose but do not overshadow it. For example if my core purpose is to help elderly with arthritis therapy at home, I will focus on how to make the design motivating, easy to use and how to make sure the therapy is done as close as possible as it is medically advised. The look of the product will mostly be designed by how it can be easy understood and used, the aesthetics will never overshadow the purpose. Being goals focused also helps me to work strategic and stay on track of the initial focus, I will not easily be distracted from what I plan on doing.
                    <p> Research is very important to me while I see the necessity of it to make a great liable design. I healthcare you can not only listen to the wishes of the user, you need to know some of the medical thoughts behind it. Also research and benchmarking helps to understand what is already known to avoid making mistakes that have already been made and to know what does work. Doing an extensive research project myself is something I have only done once, but this sparked interested. I might want to move on more toward a being a researcher for design but to understand this better I have to experience more what this would mean.
