            <h1> About </h1>
                <p> I am Lieke de Mare, a third year Industrial design student at the Technical University of Eindhoven. Outside my study I am active at the scouting, other hobbies include photography and tinkering.</p>
                <h2>Vision as designer</h2>
                    <p> I’m drawn to healthcare for not only the reason of helping the people most in need but also because I’m interested in the medical field. Everyone is different and has different needs. There are many disabilities which can result in problems you wouldn’t expect, for example how physical disabilities can limit everyday tasks. Design can help is by adapting everyday products to people with special needs, to make sure they are able to live as independently as possible.  </p>
                    <p> The medical worlds is evolving and there are more and more ways to help people improve their living quality, but sometimes it seems to me that the medical world only sees the broken bodies that need to be fixed but not the human inside the bodies. This results in great working therapies and procedures but which are not always perceived well by patients. In my opinion industrial design can be the bridge between the medical world and the patients. For example when looking at rehabilitation programs. Doctors provide exercises to patients, to improve after a medical procedure or physical problem, but for patients it might be hard to do these exercises correctly independently or to find the motivation. Products can be designed to provide motivation, make rehabilitation more fun or provide tools to make the exercises easier to perform at home. </p>
                    <p> To make a design suited for the users it is important to get to know the user group, what do they miss in what is currently provided and what are there needs. A theory that I find very important is the self-determination theory, this theory goes further that the physical needs and looks into the psychological needs. Three basic needs are: competence, autonomy and relatedness. These are important factors to deal with within a design. It shows how important it is to give autonomy to the user. This suits well for my goals in the health sector, involve patients in their own healthcare. This also suits in the current time, when talking to older generation they said they are used to the doctor is right mentality, while nowedays people have acces to internet and are more critical, they don't just listen anymore, they want autonomy, make there on decisions.</p>
                    <p> TU/e product that match my interest and vision are Hugsy (Jiachun Du, Lisa Smits, Sylvie Claes, Miguel Cabral Guerra), BackUp (Rik Bootsman) and Flow (Bruna Goveia da Rocha), they are use modern technology to improve current healthcare, with focus on not only the medical side but also the psychological side to match the needs of the users.</p>
                <h2>Identity as designer</h2>
                    <p> I'm a user focused designer with a realistic business view. To be the bridge between patient and the profesional healthcare it is important to understand the patient and design from their standpoint, taking their physical and psychological needs into account. But in the case of my main interested, healthcare, it doesn’t seem possible to be completely user focused while there are many other standpoints, like the medical side of a problem and the other stakeholders like physicians, therapists and the healtcare providers. Although I want to be user focused I understand that a product needs to be liable. All in all the goal is to make a succesfull product, perceived well by user and stakeholders and realistic in the market. </p>
                    <p> Research is also very important to me while I see the necessity of it to make a great liable design. I healthcare you can not only listen to the wishes of the user, you need to know some of the basic medical background, do psychological research to for example motivation or understanding and do technical research to how a design can be made possible. Benchmarking helps to understand what is already known to avoid making mistakes that have already been made and to know what does work. Doing an extensive research project myself is something I have only done once, but this sparked interested. Going a semester abroad confirmed for me the importance the importance and my interest in research, there there was no stimulation to do research in a project, I missed. </p>
                    <p> While many others seem to have a particular interest in a specific part of the design process, I find the whole process fascinating, how a problem can be converted into an idea, how an idea can evolve and how the idea can be made a reality. This also make my work method is very structured. When going through the steps in the design process I write everything down and make a process report. This report helps to see the overview of the research done, the different ideas and iterations and feedback that was given. The different stages, research, ideation, conceptualisation, realization and validation, give different inputs in the final design, like requirements that have to be met, what needs to be avoided and how the design can be made technological. Working structured helps me to keep focus, work as efficient as possible and keep the liability in mind. This structured way of working also made me the group leader in many projects. I kept the overview. </p>
                <h2>Future development</h2>     
                    <p> After my bachelor I will start a pre-master in Human Technology Interaction, to learn more about interaction between user and product and related psychology. This pre-master will also help me to develop as a researcher. Besides developing my knowledge I also hope to develop as a industrial designer, by stepping away from Industrial Design and taking a different look to user and technology, I hope to learn more about both my vision and my identity.</p>
