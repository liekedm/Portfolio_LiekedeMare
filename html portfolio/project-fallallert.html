                <p> With people age can become frail. A common problem is falling and not being able to get up. Nowadays many elderly use a neckless with a button, that can be pressed to get into contact with an Alarm Centre. They try to talk to the user and send help when needed. For this project we wanted to make this system more efficient and pleasurable. When talking to users there was talked about not wanting to bother loved ones but also not wanting to always get help from someone they don’t know when getting professional help. We designed a fall-alarm app that was inspired by the Reanimate Alarm app, an app from the Dutch Heart Association. This app send an alarm message to nearby users in case there is a reported cardiac arrest. This system could also be used to help an elderly who has fallen, but instead of random people the alert will go out to users in their contact list. Nowadays the standard contact list of alarm centers consist of 3 people, the one on top of the list will be called first, if that person cannot be reached the second person will be called, and so on. With the app the contact list can be broadened to as many persons as are willing to help. These people download the app and can provide their status of availability. When the elderly falls the alarm center can send a message which will automatically go to the person that is closest to the elderly and has the status of available to help. This eases the mind of the elderly, while not always the same person will be contacted and that people will not be contacted when they are set to now being available. By using distance the reaction time can also be reduced.
