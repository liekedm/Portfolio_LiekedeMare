            <h1> Research Wheelchaircushion </h1>
            <h2> Project 3 </h2>
                <p> This research project was done in collaboration with Adelante, a Dutch health care organization, we worked with the department focused on people who experience seating problems caused by sitting in a wheelchair. 
                    </br> </br> The research was done to look at how contouring of the wheelchair seating can help prevent pressure sores by looking at the distribution of pressure on the buttocks. Contouring wheelchair cushioning is already done to some extent and has proved to be useful. We have researched if a more extreme contour of the seating base can prove to be even more useful. Besides the pressure distribution, also comfort was tested on three levels of contoured seating. This tests together will give an insight in the overall effect of contoured seating on wheelchair users.
                    </br> </br> To do the tests three seating were made. These consisted of a hard base which was shaped and on top a soft foam. The contoured bases where made using a 3D model which was milled into wood. The models where shaped to resemble the anatomic shape of the buttocks and the upper legs.</p>
