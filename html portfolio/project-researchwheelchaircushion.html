            <h1> Research Wheelchaircushion </h1>
                <p> This research project was done in collaboration with Adelante, a Dutch health care organization, we worked with the department focused on people who experience seating problems caused by sitting in a wheelchair. 
                    </br> </br> The research was done to look at how contouring of the wheelchair seating can help prevent pressure sores by looking at the distribution of pressure on the buttocks. Contouring wheelchair cushioning is already done to some extent and has proved to be useful. We have researched if a more extreme contour of the seating base can prove to be even more useful. Besides the pressure distribution, also comfort was tested on three levels of contoured seating. This tests together will give an insight in the overall effect of contoured seating on wheelchair users.
                    </br> </br> To do the tests three seating were made. These consisted of a hard base which was shaped and on top a soft foam. The contoured bases where made using a 3D model which was milled into wood. The models where shaped to resemble the anatomic shape of the buttocks and the upper legs.</p>

                </div>
                <p> The tests where done within subject, meaning that each person tests all three the seatingâ€™s, the independent variable. This results in correlated measurements, which enables us to compare the different conditions of the same person over the different bases. This subsequently eliminates individual differences over the different tests.
                    </br> </br> From the pressure tests we could conclude that increased contouring has a significant positive effect on both the SPI and the area of pressure. These results suggest that increased contouring can decrease high pressure points and therefore decrease the risk of getting pressure sores.
                    </br> </br> The results from the comfort test shows a significant difference between the contours, the more contoured the more comfortable. The questionnaires where however filled in by able-bodied participants and can therefor the results cannot be generalized. The results for people with paraplegia might be different.
