                <p> Being physically active is important for your health, sitting for too long needs to be prevented. At a university many students and employees do sit for hours at the time. With a game we tried to encourage people to stand up, go outside and move for a short time. 
                    <br/>The game consist of 8 plates on the ground which need to be pressed in a certain order, representing the code of you faculty. When the code is pressed you conquer the space. The longer you have the space the more points the faculty gets. Competition is used to provide stimulation. 
                    <br/>To make the prototype we made our own button like pressure plates which where all connected to an inner plate which controlled everything. Data was also collected about the activities with the device. To get an insight in if it was understandable, did people manage to press correct codes, if it was used and when it was used. Observation from a distance also gave an insight in the interaction with the game.
