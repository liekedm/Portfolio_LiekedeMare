            <h1> Research Influence Light on Eating </h1>
                <p> Literature has confirmed that a faster eating pace is linked to an increase of body weight and a higher chance of getting obesity. In order to slow down the eating pace, we examined whether light had an influence on eating pace. This research used our product, the PacePlate, to conduct whether blue light influences the eating behavior. Participants were asked to eat two same-sized portions, one with the light from underneath the plate and one without the light. While they were eating their bites where timed. 
                    </br> Results showed that people ate slower when eating with the blue light, there was more time between bites. Questionnaires were done to see if this effect was conscious or subconscious. Many thought they ate faster with the blue light, while measurements showed they actually ate slower. This contradict each other what is very interesting.  </p>
