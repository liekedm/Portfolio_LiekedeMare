            <h2> Model making - Georgia Tech </h2>
            <p> This project was about using a 3D scan of the human body to make a perfect fitting accessory. I choose to make a wrist brace. Looking online showed that using 3D printing braces was already done in the small scale, with potential to go bigger. This is while there are many advantages of 3D printed braces or casts. They can be made using 3D scans and are therefore individual and well fitting. 3D printed casts can also have a more open structure than what is seen with plaster casts, giving room for scratching and cleaning. For my design I chose to use a Voronoi pattern. The brace is made out of two sides to make it easy to put on without the need of bending or twisting the wrist. One side is closed by elastics, this side also works as a hinges when opening the brace. The other side is closed by sliders. </p>
