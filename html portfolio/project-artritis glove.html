            <h1> Arthritis Glove </h1>
            <h2> Project 1 </h2>
                <p> Arthritis is an illness which causes inflammation and pain in the joints. It can limit flexibility and make moving painful. A common therapy is hand exercises and wearing gloves, to keep the joint warm.  
                    </br> </br> We worked on implementing lights in already existing gloves to provide feedback and information about the exercises. During the exercises the lights show information about how the movements need to be done. Lights, representing joints, use colors to show if the certain joint needs to be bend or stretched. The lights would also provide notifications to show the user when it has been more than 24, 36 or 48 hours since the last exercises has been done, as a reminder and stimulation to do the exercises frequently.
