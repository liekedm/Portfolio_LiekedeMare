            <h1> Bike Helmet </h1>
                <p> In the Netherlands, the bike is a common transportation method. Young children learn to ride a bike and use it to go to school. Most children do not wear helmets. Helmets are a good way to protect the head, a vulnerable part, especially by children, while they are still developing. 
                    </br> </br> User research showed that children don’t like wearing a helmet because they are not “cool”. For parents, the downside is that they often have to carry the helmet when the child is not wearing it. By making the helmet foldable, we hoped to make the helmet more superhero like and therefore cooler. The helmet can also be hidden easier and the flat helmet is also easier to store. This can be done in a backpocket in the jacket of the child.  </p>
