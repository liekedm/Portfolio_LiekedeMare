            <h1> Bike Head protection </h1>
                <p> In the Netherlands, the bike is a common transportation method. Young children learn to ride a bike and use it to go to school. Most children do not wear helmets. Helmets are a good way to protect the head, a vulnerable part, especially by children, while they are still developing. 
                    </br> </br> User research showed that children don’t like wearing a helmet because they are not “cool”. For parents, the downside is that they often have to carry the helmet when the child is not wearing it. By making the head protection foldable, we hoped to make the protection more superhero like and therefore cooler. The head protection can also be more easily hidden and stored. This can be done in a backpocket in the jacket of the child.  
                    </br> </br> In the design process there was focus on making the helped save and pass regulations. Shape and material had to be chosen based on material properties and regulations. The shape for example gives space for airflow to prevent overheating from the head. The inside and outside material are chosen based on the necessary properties, like how it should act under a certain amount of force. By doing simple tests we could estimate if the head protection would be able to be called a helmet under current set standards. </p>
