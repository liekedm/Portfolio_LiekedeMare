            <h1> Virtual Reality Social Media Platform </h1>
            <h2> Interactive studio - Georgia Tech </h2>
                <p> Virtual reality is evolving and gets more popular. Therefor we took a look at how VR could potentially take over social media, by designing a concept for a social media platform in a VR environment. Looking at current platform we made some services that needed to be supported. Like making posts, sharing photos and chatting. We also took a look in what VR could offer. Like 360 degrees images and video that give you the opportunity to emerge more, and using sound and visuals to give a more lifelike experience to chatting. 
                    <br/> In the final design we made a platform based on the inside and outside of a house, the outside is the inactive environment where you can make posts and see posts of others. These posts consist of the avatars of the other users holding bubbles with their post. Just simply peeking in lets you see the picture of video in a 360 degrees view. Inside you enter the active environment where you are able to see others who also entered the house and you are able to chat with them. If youâ€™re in the living room of the house this conversation is open and everybody is welcome to join, when going in a separate room you can have a private conversation.</p>
