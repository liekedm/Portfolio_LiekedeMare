            <h1> Research Company </h1>
            <h2> Design for multible stakeholders </h2>
                <p> Rituals is a company which focuses on letting people enjoy the little things in life by experiencing the small rituals we experience everyday. The sell body and home products in the middle segment, almost all product have a distict scent based on Asian traditions and ceremonys. 
                    </br> Multible analyses were done to find where a design could contribute to the shopping expierence in the store. These analysis include; interviews with employees and customers, value framework, value proposition, SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Treats), value flow model and a board of innovation.
                    </br> An important value of the company is personal contact in the store and providing an enjoyable shopping experience. This can not always be given when there are to much customers. We came up with Lit to solve this problem. Lit is a sphere which guides the customer to products which suit them most. In the beginning some questions about preferences will be asked. A sphere will light up in the colour of the product line where the customer should go. When placing the phere in a docking station light underneith the suited products will light up. </p>
