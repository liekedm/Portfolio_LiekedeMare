            <h1> Blender </h1>
            <h2> Interactive studio - Georgia Tech </h2>
                <p> For this project research needed to be done to a regular blender. The conclusion was that multiple blenders where used, small one portion blenders and big multiple servings blenders. The biggest struggle was cleaning. 
                    <br/> <br/> We had to come up with a new design to solve some struggles or explore opportunities we found. The new design was a modular blender. Different sized slots provides room to put different sized containers on the base. They can all connect to same rotation part that connects to the motor in the base. This provides the opportunity to use the same base for both a multiple serving container, a single serving container and a bowl. While there are multiple containers available the containers can also be used to store what was blended, when you want to blend something else you can just put a different container on.  The double function of the containers and the option to take out the blades reduce cleaning and make cleaning easier.
                    <br/>Other opportunities we looked into where using light to give feedback about the content of the container, before blending it might be hard to estimate how much fruit you need to get a certain amount of cups. Using a weight sensor the amount of cups can be estimated by the device, which is shown to the user using lights.
                    <br/>The last function we looked into was how you control the speed of the blender. For the small blender the standard seemed to be pressing the top, the more force you press with the faster it blends. For bigger blenders the standard seemed to be a slider or a turning knob. By combining the two blenders it might be confusing to users if they cannot use their standard way anymore. Therefor the input should also be combined and both options should be supported.
