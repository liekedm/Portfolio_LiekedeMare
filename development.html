                        <p>The first semester of the first year was important to get an insight in what is industrial design exactly and how do I see myself as an industrial designer. Looking back at the PDP I wrote this semester I recognize a lot of what I said than in my current vision and identity. In my vision I describe that I want to work in the medical field, with the reason of helping people who need it the most. In my identity I describe being structured and liking technology. I really enjoyed the course creative programming and this made me set the goal of being able to make functioning prototypes, combining electronics and programming. 
                            <br> In design for here and now I noticed how other students has a completely different outlook on industrial design. In the design process I wanted to spend time looking into the usersâ€™ needs before coming up with concepts and making prototypes to test these concepts, others just started to make low file prototypes and started testing to see how people interact with what they were given. This different perspective showed me how differs the study is and made me understand better why we need to be able to explain or vision and identity, to show our perspective and to show how we differ from others.</p>
