            <h1> Development </h1>
                <h2>User and society</h2>
                    <p> In multiple courses I was able to develops in user understanding and doing user research, an example is user-centred design, where I learned how to do user research to collect enough user understand before thinking about projects. Working with different types of users in different projects showed how much user groups can defer and how to find out their specific needs. I worked with elderly and possible caregivers, children and their parents, students and medical professionals. This also showed the importance of focusing on not only the user but also their surroundings and taking others stakeholders into account who are important to either the user or the functionality of the product. For example caregivers, healthcare professionals and family.
                </br> </br> <h2>Technology and realisation</h2>
                    <p> I have a basic understanding of technology. In courses like creative electronics and designing for physical activity, sports and vitality I learned how to work with basic sensors, Arduino and programming. This makes me able to make working prototypes to test a design.
                    <p> I have worked with multiple production technics like casting, vacuum forming, 3D printing and laser cutting. These helped me to make more high end looking prototypes and models. To make more low end and quicker made models I also worked with more basic materials like paper, cardboard, wood and foam. 
                    <p> A course I followed in the US about material and production technics thought me about different high quantity production technics and how to design for these, how this effects the shape possibilities and costs. 
                </br> </br> <h2>Business and entrepreneurship</h2>
                    <p> I have worked with different kinds of business models, like: value framework, value proposition, SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Treats), value flow model, board of innovation and service blueprint. By using this I’m able to get an understanding about how a business is build, what the different stakeholders are and what is important for the different stakeholders. I also learned about how to avoid problems a faulty design could cause, how to deal with standards, how to find patents and how to avoid liability lawsuits.
                    <p> A big part of business is also working together with different kinds of people. In group project I worked with very different kinds of designer which learned me how to deal with collaboration, outside of university I volunteer at the scouting, although this has nothing to do with design it does help me to work together with different kinds of people of different levels of education and different ages, which would of course also be the case when working in a company, where you are not surrounded by people from the same study and age. 
                    <p> Outside of working together with people collaboration is also very important in a client situation. I worked with a client in some projects which helped me to get a basic understanding of how this collaboration and communication should be handled.
                </br> </br> <h2>Math, data, computing</h2>
                    <p> Basic university courses like calculus and modelling helped me to go improve my math, data and computing skills. Working with extensive data in the course data acquisition and visualization through embodied sensors further helped me improve in data analysis. Quantitative data analysis was also used in the research project.
                    <p> I’m able to program a website using HTML and CSS. I also have experience with C++ to program Arduino and I’m currently working on improving my skills in Java while working on making apps.
                </br> </br> <h2>Creativity and aesthetics</h2>
                    <p> For me a part of creativity is creative thinking, coming up with original ideas by thinking outside of  the box. I feel like I’m strong at this and in the projects I’m able to come up with multiple ideas. While I do think goal focused with liability always in mind I might not come up with 100 crazy ideas but I will still be able to come up with enough widespread ideas.
                    <p> Looking at aesthetics as in forgiving. I’m able to make exploratory sketches which showcase by idea. In further stages I’m able to make 3d models which can be rendered and made into an animation with a realistic look which can not only show the look of the design but also help to show how the product works and how it is put together. I know the basics of space allocation which help me to not only think about de design on the outside but also on the inside, like how to deal with reinforcement and ventilation. Another part of aesthetics is aesthetics of interaction. This is very important to make a product enjoyable and easy to use. Within courses about interaction and human factors I was able to create an understanding about how to design interactions which suit the user.
