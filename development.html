            <h1> Past - How I developed </h1>
                <h2>Year 1</h2>
                    <p>The first year was important to get an insight in what is industrial design exactly and how do I see myself as an industrial designer. Looking back at the PDP I wrote that year I recognize a lot of what I said than in my current vision and identity. In my vision I describe that I want to work in the medical field, with the reason of helping people who need it the most. In my identity I describe being structured and liking technology. I really enjoyed the courses creative programming and creative electronics and this made me set the goal of being able to make functioning prototypes, combining electronics and programming. I was able to reach this goal completely in my final bachelor project.
                    <br> In courses like design for here and now and from idea to design, I noticed how other students has a completely different outlook on industrial design. In the design process I wanted to spend time looking into the usersâ€™ needs before coming up with concepts and making prototypes to test these concepts, others just started to make low file prototypes and started testing to see how people interact with what they were given. This different perspective showed me how differs the study is and made me understand better why we need to be able to explain or vision and identity, to show our perspective and to show how we differ from others. </p>
                    <p> During this year I learned the basics of a design process and was able to use this in the first semester design process. I mostly developed in the areas of User and Society, Technology and Math, Data and Computing. </p>
                <h2>Year 2</h2>
                <h2>Year 3</h2>
            <h1> Present - Who I am now </h1>
                <h2>FBP</h2>
                <h2>Expertise areas</h2>
                <h2>Skills</h2>
            <h1> Future - Who I want to be </h1>
                <p>After my bachelor I will start a pre-master in Human Technology Interaction, to learn more about interaction between user and product and related psychology. This pre-master will also help me to develop in research. Besides developing my knowledge I also hope to develop as an industrial designer, by stepping away from Industrial Design and taking a different look to user and technology, I hope to learn more about both my vision and my identity. After this premaster I want to go back to Industrial Design for my master. For a professional career I would like to work in the medical field in big company like Philips or work in a research center for a rehabilitation clinic or hospital. </p>
