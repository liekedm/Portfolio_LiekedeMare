                    <p>The first year was important to get an insight in what is industrial design exactly and how do I see myself as an industrial designer. Looking back at the PDP I wrote that year I recognize a lot of what I said than in my current vision and identity. In my vision I describe that I want to work in the medical field, with the reason of helping people who need it the most. In my identity I describe being structured and liking technology. I really enjoyed the courses creative programming and creative electronics and this made me set the goal of being able to make functioning prototypes, combining electronics and programming. I was able to reach this goal completely in my final bachelor project.
                    <br> In courses like design for here and now and from idea to design, I noticed how other students has a completely different outlook on industrial design. In the design process I wanted to spend time looking into the users’ needs before coming up with concepts and making prototypes to test these concepts, others just started to make low file prototypes and started testing to see how people interact with what they were given. This different perspective showed me how differs the study is and made me understand better why we need to be able to explain or vision and identity, to show our perspective and to show how we differ from others. </p>
                    <p> During this year I learned the basics of a design process and was able to use this in the first semester design process. I mostly developed in the areas of User and Society, Technology and Math, Data and Computing. </p>

                    <h3>First semester </h3>
                    <p>When choosing what to do in this semester I didn’t feel mature enough to work in a company, I also didn’t feel ready, therefor I decided to do an exchange. This would both help me grow as a person, by going out of my comfort zone, as help me to develop as an industrial designer. </p>
                    <p>I was already able to make basic 3D models, but I learned new technics that allowed me to make more complicated shapes and assemblies that are based on parameters, to make them adaptable. I also learned how to implement standard parts, like screws, use 3D scans to make 3D models fit to the human body and how to make animations and renders with the models. In the course Materials productions methods and materials where discussed, how they influences the design and costs. These where mostly high scale production methods but some were also used in model making to make prototypes, like vacuum forming and casting. Human factors was an interesting course about ergonomics, cognitive abilities and how the working of the eyes and ears should be taken into account.</p>
                    <p>I also got a better understanding about who I am as a person and who I am as a designer. In the US Industrial Design is very different, there is much more focus on skills and form giving and less focus on doing research and doing through the design process yourself. In projects clear instructions where given in what you needed to design and it was explained how you needed to do that. This made me realize how much I like going through the full process and the engineering rational part of industrial design. I don’t just want to do, I want to think.</p>
                    <h3>Second semester </h3>
                    <p>In the last semester I worked with apps a lot, I learned how to make an app in creative apps and both my final bachelor project, walker, as the concept in design innovation methods, fall alert, consisted of an app. This did change my outlook on apps, in my first year PDP I said I didn’t like digitalization, at that time referring to tangible being replaced by apps, in my second year PDP, I say I don’t like designing apps while they lack experience. Now I look at this differently, I think I now better see opportunities that apps can give. Like reducing the size of a product while the phone can be used as a screen and making it more accessible and easier to accept, while users don’t need to buy and carry a new device. I don’t think they necessarily reduce the experience of interactions, they provide a different experience. Although I’m still against replacing simple buttons with an app, I do see myself using them for the functionalities they offer, like a good screen, GPS, internet access and having multiple output options. </p>
                    <p>Outside of the regular courses, I worked on adapting the paper of project 3, about wheelchair cushions. We were given the opportunity to work on publishing the paper. To make this possible some rewriting had to be done. This allowed us to get a better understanding in research, while we had to look with a more critical eye to what we had done and what had to be changed.</p>
           </br> <h1> Present - Who I am now </h1>
                <h2>FBP</h2>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="line1"> <a href="html portfolio/project-FBP.html"> <img src="img/fbp_small.png" title="Walker"> </a></div>
                       </div>
                <h2>Expertise areas</h2>
                    <h3>User and society </h3>
                    <p>In multiple courses I was able to develops in user understanding and doing user research, an example is user-centered design, where I learned how to do user research to collect enough user understand before thinking about projects. Working with different types of users in different projects showed how much user groups can defer and how to find out their specific needs. I worked with elderly and possible caregivers, children and their parents, students and medical professionals. Different projects and the course Designing for multiple stakeholders showed the importance of focusing on not only the user but also their surroundings and taking others stakeholders into account who are important to either the user or the functionality of the product. For example caregivers, healthcare professionals and family. A theory that I find very important is the self-determination theory, this theory goes further that the physical needs and looks into the psychological needs. Three basic needs are: competence, autonomy and relatedness. These are important factors to deal with within a design. It shows how important it is to give autonomy to the user. This suits well for my goals in the health sector, involve patients in their own healthcare.</p>
                    <h3>Technology and realization </h3>
                    <p>I have a basic understanding of technology. In courses like creative electronics and designing for physical activity, sports and vitality I learned how to work with basic sensors, Arduino and programming. This makes me able to make working prototypes to test a design. My most advanced technological project was my final bachelor project, where I worked with two measurement devices that sent data through Bluetooth to an app that converted the data to useful output. <br>I have worked with multiple production technics like casting, vacuum forming, 3D printing and laser cutting. These helped me to make more high end looking prototypes and models. To make more low end and quicker made models I also worked with more basic materials like paper, cardboard, wood and foam. A course I followed in the US about material and production technics thought me about different high quantity production technics and how to design for these, how this effects the shape possibilities and costs. </p>
                    <h3>Business and entrepreneurship </h3>
                    <p>I have worked with different kinds of business models, like: value framework, value proposition, SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Treats), value flow model, board of innovation and service blueprint. By using this I’m able to get an understanding about how a business is build, what the different stakeholders are and what is important for the different stakeholders. I also learned about how to avoid problems a faulty design could cause, how to deal with standards, how to find patents and how to avoid liability lawsuits. A big part of business is also working together with different kinds of people. In group project I worked with very different kinds of designer which learned me how to deal with collaboration, outside of university I volunteer at the scouting, although this has nothing to do with design it does help me to work together with different kinds of people of different levels of education and different ages, which would of course also be the case when working in a company, where you are not surrounded by people from the same study and age. Outside of working together with people collaboration is also very important in a client situation. I worked with a client in some projects which helped me to get a basic understanding of how this collaboration and communication should be handled. </p>
                    <h3>Math, data, computing </h3>
                    <p>Basic university courses like calculus and modelling helped me to go improve my math, data and computing skills. Working with extensive data in the course data acquisition and visualization through embodied sensors and the research project further helped me improve in data analysis. I’m able to program a website using HTML and CSS. I also have experience with C++ to program Arduino and I’m able to make apps using Java coding in Android Studio. In my final bachelor project I integrated some data analyses to go from input to output, this had to be done automatically and was therefore very different from the data analysis that was done in a research context, outliers for example had to be recognized and removed.</p>
                    <h3>Creativity and aesthetics </h3>
                    <p>For me a part of creativity is creative thinking, coming up with original ideas by thinking outside of the box. I feel like I’m strong at this and in the projects I’m able to come up with multiple ideas. While I do think goal focused with liability always in mind I might not come up with 100 crazy ideas but I will still be able to come up with enough widespread ideas. Looking at aesthetics as in forgiving. I’m able to make exploratory sketches which showcase by idea. In further stages I’m able to make 3d models which can be rendered and made into an animation with a realistic look which can not only show the look of the design but also help to show how the product works and how it is put together. I know the basics of space allocation which help me to not only think about de design on the outside but also on the inside, like how to deal with reinforcement and ventilation. Another part of aesthetics is aesthetics of interaction. This is very important to make a product enjoyable and easy to use. Within courses about interaction and human factors I was able to create an understanding about how to design interactions which suit the user.</p>
            </br> <h1> Future - Who I want to be </h1>
                <p>After my bachelor I will start a pre-master in Human Technology Interaction, to learn more about interaction between user and product and related psychology. This pre-master will also help me to develop in research. Besides developing my knowledge I also hope to develop as an industrial designer, by stepping away from Industrial Design and taking a different look to user and technology, I hope to learn more about both my vision and my identity. After this premaster I want to go back to Industrial Design for my master. For a professional career I would like to work in the medical field in big company like Philips or work in a research center for a rehabilitation clinic or hospital. </p>
